# emulator

## Project description
Virtualized platform for testing IoT applications which enables a possibility to create virtual devices on-demand which along with real embedded devices could be put in the emulated environment driven by the scenarios. Devices instead of reading data from real sensors will be using virtual ones located in the virtual environment. This enables a possibility to repetitively execute the testing scenarios and observing how the new versions of tested application behave facing the same readings from the sensors. Moreover, virtual environment composed of the virtual devices can be set up on almost any computer simplifying the development process of the IoT applications.
